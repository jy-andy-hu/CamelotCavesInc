    "text": "About the Case\nCamelot Caves Inc. (CCI) aims to bridge the gap between analytics and management accounting, providing a comprehensive learning experience for students from both disciplines. The case will offer various starting points, catering to different learning appetites, allowing inclusivity and adaptability. The core objective is to implement an end-to-end analytics project, encompassing skills including data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), data modeling, documentation, visual analytics, and then use the solution as cornerstone for the application of management accounting techniques, such as contribution margin analysis.\nStudents will engage with real-life, messy data from a home-grown Canadian winery business, allowing them to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios. The case will emphasize contribution margin analysis and business planning/advisory, integrating both quantitative and qualitative factors for short-term and long-term decision-making."
